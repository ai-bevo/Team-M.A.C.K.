Study: Looking at Type Two Diabetes, Possible Environmental Correlation due to poverty rates and demographic region.

Abstract:
Type Two Diabetes is significant issue facing the United States.  According to the Center for Disease Control, “More than 37 million Americans have diabetes (about 1 in 10), and approximately 90-95% of them have type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes most often develops in people over age 45.” (LINK) Our study is an attempt to look at specific, quantifiable correlations.  

Methods of Approach:
In order to look for correlation is to approach it from two different vectors; poverty, demographic region.

Poverty: Using the US census data we will look at poverty rates.  We have agreed to divide our data into the following areas; 
•	Low, middle, and high income based on data from 2020 

Demographic Region: We have decided to limit our approach based on zip code. (> 500K) or low population zip codes (<50K).  In order to limit possible outcomes, we will choose two representative samples from each for four total locations.

Team Responsibilities

In order to adequately divide up the roles and responsibilities we have decided to break the project into four parts.  Each member will be assigned a role.

1.	Data gathering: One person will be assigned to gather the data from each of the agreed upon API/data sources
2.	Data Manipulation/cleaning: One person assigned
3.	Data Visualization: Two people Assigned: Assigned to create the 6-8 plots.
4.	Project finalization and conclusions (ADDL): One person will be assigned      to   write the conclusions and summarize them in a written presentation using PowerPoint or google docs.
APIs to be used: US Census, CDC
